EscapeTheRoom
=============
A simple Escape the Room style puzzle game developed using Unity 4.3 and MiddleVR. It's designed for use within a [CAVE](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cave_automatic_virtual_environment) with position tracking and a wand, so it goes without saying that it won't run properly without the necessary equipment.
